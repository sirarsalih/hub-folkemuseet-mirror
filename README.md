# Augmented Reality for Norsk Folkemuseum

A pro bono Augmented Reality (AR) project developed for [Norsk Folkemuseum](https://norskfolkemuseum.no/) as part of the Hubs work at [Making Waves](https://www.makingwaves.com/).

## Weather PWA Sample Template

We use the [Weather PWA sample](https://dzone.com/articles/building-progressive-web-applications-pwa-with-vis) as a template, we are thus thankful for Jonathan Danylko's free contribution.

## Tech

We use ASP.NET Core MVC for the back-end and simple JavaScript for the front-end that harnesses a service worker.

## Setup

1. Download and install the [.NET Core 1.0.4 executable](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/1.0.4-download.md).
2. Clean, build and run solution.
